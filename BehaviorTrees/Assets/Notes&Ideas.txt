Pull tasks from an xml document
Children of xml nodes are the children of that task
Game objects intended to be interfaced by tasks need a "TaskInterface" class
- Will have a dictionary called "conditions" that uses string keys to get boolean values
- Will have a dictionary called "actions" that has a dictionary containing function references
  - These functions should return a boolean value corresponding to success or failure, and have no inputs
  - Specifically, "Func<bool>"
All tasks can be "inverted" with the "invert" entry
